            <h1>BenBen's Portfolio Cheat Sheet</h1>

                <p>Recently, I've found myself energized by conversations with designers in school or early in their careers. Shoutout to everyone I've met from RIT and Figma! These conversations have been refreshing, and I hope I've provided feedback that's both helpful and reassuring.</p>

                <p>Several themes have emerged from these portfolio reviews, so I thought I'd share them as a sort of cheat sheet for anyone working on their design portfolio. Whether you're a design student preparing to graduate, an early-career designer refining your presentation, or someone switching into design from another field—these tips are for you.</p>

                <h2>1. Make It Yours</h2>

                    <p>First and foremost, remember that it's your portfolio. There's no right or wrong way to do it. Create it how you think it should be made. That said, In today's job market, you only have a few seconds to catch a hiring manager's attention before they move on to the next portfolio. Anything you can do to make yourself stand out is a game changer.</p>

                    <p>Don't be afraid to be different! Many portfolios nowadays look identical. Making your portfolio stand out and reflect your unique personality adds tremendous value. Hiring managers and other designers want to get a sense of who you are. They'll HOPEFULLY become your boss or colleagues spending 40 hours a week with you, so they naturally want to know what you're passionate about!</p>

                    <p>Example: One of my favorite portfolios and interviews was with a candidate who absolutely loved painting. They had a whole section of their site dedicated to their paintings. It wasn’t the main center point of their site, but seeing their painting style, it instantly clicked on how they incorporated some of their paint style in their decks and presentations. It was truly awesome, and showcased a skill they had that made them stand out! At the time we were looking for someone to do more illustrations and it was a huge plus to have someone that understood different mediums. Now this doesn’t mean style everything to match one thing you like, but if its tangentially related to design work, and showcases something your passionate about then put it on your site! It can even just be a blurb on an about me page.</p>

                <h2>2. Master Hierarchy</h2>
