            <h1 class="fade-in">Weekly Review: Feb 17, 2025</h1>
            <p>This week has been a back and forth between work and my creative projects. I took a big step and published my first few short videos on YouTube and TikTok. It's been exciting watching the engagement grow - my first video gained traction after about a day on both platforms. Though interestingly, my follow-up videos have been pretty quiet. I've started analyzing posting times and content types to understand what works best on each platform. It's become its own engaging puzzle to solve.</p>
    
            <p>Outside of that, I've been switching between coding projects and new design vision sprints at work. While all the RTO discussions and business changes have made focusing a bit challenging, I've found that balancing work with my creative hobbies has helped ease the pressure I used to put on myself. That constant feeling of not doing enough has finally started to lift.</p>
            <ul>Books:
                <li>Finished: <a href="https://simonsinek.com/books/the-infinite-game/" target="_blank">The Infinite Game</a></li>
                <li>Started: <a href="https://patflynn.com/book/superfans/" target="_blank">Superfans</a></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>Soundtrack:
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY9q5jS4nqI" target="_blank">Infinite Health â€¢ Tycho</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Till next time</p>
