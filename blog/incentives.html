        <h1>The Power of Incentives: Lessons from the NFL and Design Teams</h1>
        
        <p>
As the NFL regular season wrapped up yesterday, we saw some of the most heartwarming moments in sports (maybe not if your a team owner): star players hitting their contract incentives. For those not familiar, these incentives are performance-based targets—like sacks, passing yards, or receiving yards—that reward players with impressive bonuses. Yesterday had some great highlights:

Von Miller hit his sack target, earning an extra $1.5M.

Geno Smith, despite playing through an injury, secured a $6M bonus with a clutch game-winning performance.

My personal favorite: Mike Evans, a future Hall of Famer, fought for just 5 more yards to lock in a $3M bonus and make him one of the most consistent wide receivers of all time. 

What made the last  moment so special wasn’t just Mike’s achievement, but how his teammates rallied behind him. On the final play of the game—when they could have played it safe—they helped him cross the finish line (with maybe a little help from some soft defensive coverage). 

It also wasn’t just about money—it was about teamwork. When your teammates go out of their way to help you reach your goals, it builds trust, fosters camaraderie, and creates unforgettable moments of shared celebration. That energy is contagious, and not only gives you the support to do your best, but makes you want to go above and beyond to support your teammates too. 

This got me thinking about incentives and how they shape behavior, not just on the field but in the workplace, especially on design teams. Good incentives don’t just motivate individuals—they build a culture where everyone is pulling in the same direction and proud of what they’re creating together.

Design Is a Team Sport

No matter how talented a designer you are, collaboration is key. You need engineers, product managers, and other cross-functional partners to bring your ideas to life and deliver real value to customers. The best work happens when trust and shared goals form the foundation of your team.

When I was at DoorDash, our Ordering Experience team was a perfect example of this. Sure, we each had our own goals (OKRs), but we knew that hitting those goals meant helping each other. I was recently reminiscing with my favorite PM, Ariel, about how our team’s goofy, trusting, and supportive culture made that time some of the most rewarding in our careers. 

One thing that made a huge difference? Sharing our OKRs openly. It might seem like a small thing, but being transparent about your goals creates opportunities for collaboration and vulnerability. When you know what your teammates are working toward, you can step in to help, cheer them on, and celebrate their wins.A great example of both these in practice, was when Ariel and I created an "Eagle Eye Award". Every week at standup I got to recognize an engineer who went out of their way to make something they shipped pixel perfect and high attention to detail. Sure, there were fun prizes like changing your Zoom background or Slack status to a majestic Bald Eagle, but the real win was having a team bonding moment where we can all celebrate together every week. As you can imagine, it started off slow, but once gave it out a couple times and spread the love around people were beaming with pride when they received it. And the best part, the product got better and we shipped stuff with less bugs. OKRs hit, Incentives created, Teamwork and wins all around.

When Incentives Go Sideways

Incentives are powerful, but they can cause tension if they’re not aligned with the bigger picture, or there are teams with competing incentives. On one team I was apart of, engineers were incentivized to ship features that directly impacted the business’s bottom line. Sounds great, right? The problem was, other critical work—like fixing bugs and improving quality—got deprioritized. This led to a backlog of unresolved issues that slowed development, frustrated users, and ultimately caused months of technical debt. 

In more recent years I’ve seen and heard a lot of design teams prioritize measurable business impact over user experience. While this might boost short-term metrics, it often comes at the expense of building products users truly love—those that feel intuitive, solve real problems seamlessly, and leave users excited to come back.  One of my favorite books and sources for inspiration, Unreasonable Hospitality, highlights how creating unbelievably magical experiences leads to an amazing buisness. Maybe it's just my inner “boomer designer” who cares deeply about users, but I truly believe that putting users first is the real secret to longterm business success. 

How to Build Better Incentives

If you’re in a situation where the incentives you believe in feel out of sync with your team or are having trouble to explain your point of view, here are some ideas to help:

Create Your Own Metrics for Success: Set clear, measurable goals for user experience improvements (People love numbers) For example, track metrics like bug fixes, number of visual improvements, task completion rates or customer satisfaction scores. Bonus: Try and make friends with some analytics folks, they have all the juicy deets on data and how to structure even better metrics :) 

Use Qualitative Data: Don’t underestimate the power of research insights. Focus on how your designs make people feel—are they intuitive, enjoyable, and meet their expectations ? Do users think it feels like a premium product? Are they more willing to give you money based on how trustworthy it feels? Use these as talking points to explain why they matter, and ladder up to bigger business goals.

Base Goals Around User Feedback: Incorporate what users are actually saying into your objectives. When goals are grounded in real-world needs, they’re more impactful. Using quotes and stories to exemplify how big of a pain point these are, and how you can help!

Be Transparent: Share your personal and team incentives. This fosters trust and opens the door for collaboration. The more transparent you are, the more people will help you! And even better you might be able to help others achieve their goals.

Create Your Own Incentives: Making your own award, or having moments of recognition for your teammates can go a long way to fostering a better team dynamic and culture. Plus if your a goofy person like me, having moments in the week to be yourself around your team makes not only you happy, but lets your teammates be their authentic selves too.

Balance Business and User Goals: Advocate for projects that prioritize user needs while showing how they contribute to long-term business success. Metrics like Existing User Return Rate, or metrics that focus on creating repeatable and consistent user behavior always prove worthwhile.

Wrapping Up

While we all might not get million dollar bonuses for fixing logo and button alignment, incentives remind us of the magic that happens when individual and team achievements align. Whether you’re playing football or designing products, fostering a culture of trust, collaboration, and celebration leads to amazing results.Maybe I missed something?
