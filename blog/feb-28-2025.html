            <h1 class="fade-in">Weekly Review: Feb 28, 2025</h1>
            <p>So I totally dropped the ball and forgot to post earlier this week. Oops! But hey, better late than never, right?</p>
        
            <p>This week has actually been pretty great. Kicked things off with a cool work project that's getting some nice momentum, which feels awesome.</p>
        
            <p>Mid-week I headed into the city to speak at this Figma Event. It's been forever since I've been around that many people, and I'm not gonna lie - seeing that line outside freaked me out a bit. Took a walk around the block to calm down and <span class="highlight">LITERALLY RAN INTO DANIEL RICCIARDO</span>. Still can't believe it! It was just a split second, but seeing one of my favorite athletes somehow zapped away all my nerves about speaking.</p>
        
            <p>The event itself was a blur of good vibes. Got to catch up with old coworkers and friends I've been missing way too much lately. Definitely need to make more effort to see these people!</p>
        
            <p>My talk went fine - fumbled a couple times but got my points across okay. Afterward was just a mad rush of questions. Sorry if you were there and I seemed frazzled while answering you! It was a bit much, but in a good way. Really cool seeing so many students and young designers so pumped about the industry.</p>
        
            <p>My secret weapon? Brought Pok√©mon cards! Sharing what I love always helps me feel comfortable, and what started as my personal security blanket turned into a whole card-trading frenzy. Definitely doing that again!</p>
        
            <p>Overall, a pretty awesome week of pushing my boundaries. Got some new project ideas brewing that I'm excited about. Thinking I'll start adding a project status section to these weekly posts too.</p>
            
            <ul>Project Status:
                <li>P&B JV: Still in development, working on beta</li>
                <li>Pokemon: +117 Instagram followers, +142 TikTok and -1 Youtube LOL</li>
                <li>Someday (nameTBD): Ideation and breif phase</li>
            </ul>
            
            <ul>Books:
                <li>In Progress <a href="https://patflynn.com/book/superfans/" target="_blank">Superfans</a></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>Soundtrack:
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox29z5Nf1Uk" target="_blank">Big Bang @ MAMA (if you havent seen this your missing out)</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Till next time</p>
