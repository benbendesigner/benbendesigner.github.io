            <p>Another rainy/early spring week here in NY! Although the trees are just starting to pop which I am very excited to go outside and grill some more! If you don't know (idk why you would, unless your Paul in which case. Hi Paul!) I bought a PK grill last year after hours upon hours spent in the Youtube grilling/bbq rabbit hole. It's honestly one of my favorite things to do in the summer cause it's so easy and the results are awesome. Officially in dad-mode I guess LOL.</p>
    
            <p>In other news, projects are humming along. It's been a bit tough balancing all the projects but I think with the economy hits lately, I am trying to focus less on business issues and thinking more about doing work that makes me happy and inspired.</p>
    
            <p>It's a tough line to walk when you're a product designer. Trying to balance business goals with creatively fulfilling and projects that excite you. When I talk to a lot of people in the industry it seems to be a common issue with a lot of folks. I might make a post about this in the future, but one video clip that has been stuck in my head all weekend was a <a href="https://youtu.be/AjKGToaFDvA?t=340" target="_blank">clip</a> from Casey Neistat's latest video on the Switch 2. The last thing he ends with is "The metric they care the most about at Nintendo is still Fun" and that is what I think I aspire to. At the end of the day it's not about making the most money, or shareholder value, it's about making something fun and for people to enjoy.</p>
