            <h1 class="fade-in">Much Ado About Deals</h1>
            
            <p class="fade-in">Jan 10, 2025</p>

            <p class="fade-in">Some context setting... I love deals, but especially when we were in hyper growth startup mode, we launched "Deals" as a small carousel, and then a store callout, and then it slowly ballooned into a runaway train.</p>
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in">As you can imagine, when you hit a goldmine like Deals, the obvious solution is to maximize, scale and repeat it as many times as possible. It begs the question: "If deals perform so well, WHY CANT EVERYTHING BE A DEAL?!". This was a challenge we had on the design team, because we didn't have enough levers to pull to create a hierarchy that could facilitate all these callouts. Once you make one thing stand out, you need something louder...and louder...and louder. Eventually it just becomes so loud, you lose track of what you were doing in the first place.
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in">
                Enter this analogy... I used an analogy comparing Walmart and Target to explain this deal density issues to product and marketing teams. While it might be a bit outdated, it still resonates with me as a framework for understanding design and user experience. Analogies and real world examples really help me communicate and align with partners easier. It also helped to show how we can evoke such different emotional responses and how applying their approaches can inform our design strategies.
            </p>

            <h2 class="fade-in">Walmart vs. Target: The Emotional Divide</h2>

            <p class="fade-in">
                Walmart is a no-frills, utilitarian experience. You know what you're getting, and you know what to expect. It's a place where you can find everything you need at a low price, without much fuss. Walmart doesn't evoke much emotional attachment. It's functional, but not inspiring.
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in">
                Target, on the other hand, has a cult following. Memes on TikTok and Instagram about going in for one item and leaving with a cart full of stuff you didn't need. As a new dad, I've even discovered baby toys featuring the Target dog. Yes, Target's items might be more expensive, but they feel curated and of higher quality. A deal you're proud of, rather than just something cheap.
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in">
                The key difference? Marketing and Placement. Both stores sell similar products, but the emotional journey they create for their customers couldn't be more different.
            </p>

            <h2 class="fade-in">Design Lessons from Store Layouts</h2>

            <p class="fade-in">
                Both Walmart and Target use predictable layouts to create a sense of familiarity. If you've been to one, you can probably navigate a new store without much trouble. However, Target takes it a step further with visual cues that make sections feel distinct.
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in">
                At Walmart, you're confronted with rows of numbered aisles. It's practical but requires effort to locate what you need. In contrast, Target uses design elements to make each section stand out. When you're in home goods, it feels like home goods—not just because of the products, but because of the colors, the merchandising, and the overall layout. This subtle differentiation enhances the shopping experience and makes it more intuitive.
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in"><strong>Takeaway:</strong> While sometimes Numbered Aisles are speedy, Using visual way-finding and anchors to differentiate sections and guide users effortlessly and is more engaging.</p>

            <h2 class="fade-in">Merchandising: The Art of Discovery</h2>

            <p class="fade-in">
                Target excels at creating a sense of discovery. Deals aren't plastered everywhere; they're strategically placed in predictable spots, like non-visible end caps. This subtlety makes finding deals feel like an accomplishment. Shoppers don't just find products; they hunt for treasures and brag about their "finds" afterward on Instagram or to their friends.
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in">
                Walmart, by contrast, focuses on overt visibility deals are everywhere, but the experience lacks the same emotional reward. 's transactional rather than engaging.
            </p>

            <p class="fade-in"><strong>Takeaway:</strong> You don't need deals everywhere. If you give people the reward without working for it, they won't feel the same level of accomplishment. Create moments of discovery to engage users emotionally and reward interaction.</p>

            <h2 class="fade-in">How This Applies to Digital Design</h2>

            <p class="fade-in">Here's how we can translate these insights into actionable design principles:</p>

            <ul class="fade-in">
                <li>
                    <strong>Conventional Patterns:</strong> Use predictable layouts consistent with users mental models, like how store layouts are intuitive at both Walmart and Target. You don't spend time trying to find the section, you spend time looking at the items, which is where the $$ is.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Visual Differentiation:</strong> Use visual anchors and cues to create distinct sections, guiding users seamlessly through the experience. Having hierarchy also lets you control the amount of content on the page, especially callouts like deals. If everything is important, nothing is. Likewise if everything looks the same, it's hard to stand out.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Optimize for your Items:</strong> Especially in more recent stores, Target uses different layouts to optimize and create more curated moments in different sections. Specifically makeup stand sout to me. Makeup uses bright lighting, and is more free-flowing with mirrors and shorter counters, so people can try on makeup and converse with a friend in another aisle. Just cause you have a system, means you can't create optimized and curated moments as long as it feels cohesive and flows with the other content.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Moments of Delight & Magic:</strong> Don't overload users with deals. Make them work (in a fun way) to uncover rewards, fostering a sense of accomplishment. Using unique interactions like swipe to reveal, heck, I have pitched “blowing into the microphone to show confetti fly” so many times... these moments of delight create an experience people want to come back to.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Emotional Connection:</strong> Create designs that resonate emotionally to build loyalty and turn users into advocates. Lean on qualitative user feedback to illustrate that value.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Personalization:</strong> Cater to different user preferences. Some prioritize deals, while others value relevance and consistency. Flexible design patterns can address both, and unlike a real store, you could potentially have a "best of both worlds". Bend the reality to work for you!
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="fade-in">Personal Story: Dreams Do Come True</h2>
            <p class="fade-in">Now is probably confess that I am extremely biased in this topic... When I was a kid, my dream job was to work at Target. My mom even made me a Target-themed birthday cake. At 15, I applied to work there but didn't get the job.... Thankfully, future me fulfilled that dream in a unique way. While working at Odopod, I designed an installation inside a real Target store. For a few days, I observed customers interacting with our project, interviewed them, and even got access to the coveted employee break room. It was a blast and a reminder that dreams can come true in unexpected ways.</p>

            <h2 class="fade-in">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="fade-in">The Walmart vs. Target analogy provides a powerful lens for understanding layout, and content design. It's not just about what you offer but how you present it and the emotions you evoke. By learning from these retail stores, we can craft experiences that resonate, engage, and delight our users. It also creates an example that others resonate with, and might make pitching new ideas land better.</p>
